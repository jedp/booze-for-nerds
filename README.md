Drinks for Nerds
================

The Elephant in the Room
------------------------

In a champagne glass (either a flute or coupe, I suppose, though probably a
flute would be better):

  1. 1.5 oz gin (up to 2.5 oz for a larger elephant)
  2. A good squeeze of fresh lemon juice
  3. 1.5 tsp simple syrup
  4. Champagne to fill

Note: I believe that adding too much lemon or simple syrup will destroy the
sublime poetry of this drink.  It is essential that the chief sensation and
taste be that of champagne.  The imbiber must not be made suspicious that,
through the device of excess sweetness or bitterness, something is being
hidden; the elephant must be concealed in plain view.

Second note: Sublime poetry may well devolve into raucous versification after
two or three elephants have been exposed for what they are.

I initially formulated this drink without simple syrup, but, having
experimented on my relatives, I find that not everyone shares my love of
bitter, dry things.  (I, for instance, prefer gin and XPCOM without any
vermouth at all.)
